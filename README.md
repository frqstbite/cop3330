# COP3330

This repository contains the code, scriptwriting, and video projects behind my
COP3330 assignments. The course syllabus is available online [here][syllabus].

## Project Structure

Each assignment has its own project directory within the root directory of this
repository. The project directories follow a common structure, described below.

### Code

The starter file for each assignment is available in an accompanying
`driver.cpp`, if provided. Each assignment contains a `solution` directory that
contains my attempted solution.

### Devlog

Each assignment has a `devlog.md` file describing the authentic, real-time
experience of writing and debugging the program. This devlog will primarily
server to inform the scriptwriting process.

### Script

After the program has been sufficiently tested and the devlog has been
finalized, a script is written to `script.md` to communicate the key points in
the video. Code snippets are included to supplement the visuals added in post.

### Video

Finally, the video is composited in [Motion Canvas][motioncanvas], the project
for which is stored in the assignment's `video` folder.
