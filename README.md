# COP3330

This repository contains the code, scriptwriting, and video projects behind my
COP3330 assignments. The course syllabus is available online [here][syllabus].

## Project Structure

The [Motion Canvas][motioncanvas] project used to composite the videos
submitted alongside the code is in the `videos/` directory. Each assignment has
a corresponding [project][motioncanvas-project] that renders into that
assignment's video. For more information, refer to the Motion Canvas
[documentation][motioncanvas-docs].

Additionally, each assignment has its own project directory and README file
with details on the expectations for the final program. The project directories
follow a common structure described below.

### Code

Any project files that are provided with the assignment will be located under
the `problem/` directory for immediate reference. The attempted solution will
be under the `solution/` directory, from which the `makefile` for the
assignment will build.

### Devlog

Each assignment has a `devlog.md` file describing the authentic, real-time
experience of writing and debugging the program. This devlog will primarily
serve to inform the scriptwriting process.

### Script

After the program has been sufficiently tested and the devlog has been
finalized, a script is written to `script.md` to communicate the key points in
the video. Code snippets are included to supplement the visuals added in post
when necessary.
